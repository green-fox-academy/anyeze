/*<!-- You can work in the html or in a separate js file. Like:
    <script>
      If the fourth p has a 'dolphin' class, replace apple's content with 'pear'
      If the first p has an 'apple' class, replace cat's content with 'dog'
      Make apple red by adding a .red class
      Make balloon less balloon-like (change its shape)
    </script>
